Wy I made this
--------------

The main reason is take a first approach to a mobile development but without
touching native code.
Also, there are other reasons:
 * Make a first development with Titanium SDK
 * Know how to work with the camera
 * Know how to work with SQLite
 * Know how to use third-party modules, in this example a barcode reader from scandit
